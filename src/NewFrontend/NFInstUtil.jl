```
restoreMissingArrayVariables!(flatModel::FlatModel)
```
  Some variables are never defined in the flat model.
  They can appear everywhere as expressions,
  the easiest case is where these variables occur as
  lhs = rhs, but they may also appear in binary expressions etc.
    The easiest way to deal with the is to create one variable
    for each cref of an array type where the parent cref is not a record.

  Each of these variables can be assumed to have been scalarized previously.
  Hence, we know the size and the component of the particular vector.
  For each such array variable appearing in an equation
  we create the variable and an additional equation.
If the NF_SCALARIZE flag is set to false the function will do nothing.
