Prints an execution stat on the format:
  Execstat <name> -> time: <seconds>s, alloc'd: <bytes> bytes (cumulative)
where `time` is the wall time since the last `execStat` call (the timer is
reset per call so successive entries give per-phase wall time), and `alloc'd`
is the cumulative allocated bytes since module load (a running total — the
GC baseline `MODELICA_GC_NUM` is captured at module load and is `const`, so
we cannot reset it per-call without further changes).

No-op when `Flags.EXEC_STAT` is not set.
